# Machine Learning Course Project
We examine machine learning approaches on several datasets.
Some methods are implmented by myself and some are third party algorithms.
Generally, the methods implemented by myself is slower and for practicing.
I highly recommended users use the existed third party in case of using.
## basic data setting
We assume that a data is with feature `x` and label `y`.
`x` can be stored in a numpy array or simple Python array
